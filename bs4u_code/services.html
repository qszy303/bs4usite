                        <p>Many conditions can be detected at an early stage during your regular checkup and 
                            cleaning visits. Early detection and treatment will help you avoid potentially 
                            serious, painful, and costly dental problems in the future. Keeping your teeth and 
                            gums clean is important, not just for oral hygiene but also for your overall health. 
                            Having a professional dental cleaning every six months is one of the best ways to
                            prevent serious dental problems. </p>

                <h4>Periodontal Care</h4>
                <p>Did you know that roughly half of American adults have periodontal disease? 
                    Periodontal disease is a common, yet entirely preventable, health issue. 
                    When a simple cleaning is not sufficient to solve your gum problem (also known as 
                    periodontitis), you will need a deep cleaning (also known as scaling and root 
                    planning). During the treatment, the dentist will clean underneath your gums and remove any tartar
                    or calculus. Combining with localized applied antibiotic-Arrestin and regular 
                    Perio Maintenance, we want to make sure your smile isn’t one that’s affected by 
                    periodontal disease.</p>

            <div class="pediatric-subsection">
                <h4>Fluoride Treatments</h4>
                <p>Bacteria, sugars, and acid that linger in your mouth can harm tooth enamel and 
                    damage teeth. Topical fluoride treatments help protect your teeth from these 
                    harmful substances and can even reverse early signs of decay. Studies show that 
                    fluoride is an important mineral for all age, especially children.

            <div class="pediatric-subsection">
                <h4>Dental Sealants</h4>
                <p>This simple, painless treatment only takes a few minutes. But it could protect your 
                    teeth for years by keeping plaque and decay away. A thin, plastic coating will be 
                    applied to your teeth at deep grooves or pits, which are the most susceptible area to 
                    cavities.  It is proven to be one of the most efficient methods to protect your child’s 
                    teeth. This treatment also help you maintain a beautiful, healthy smile.

                <h4>Oral Cancer Screening</h4>
                <p>Oral cancer screenings can help detect the early stages of oral cancer. Do not 
                    ignore suspicious lumps or ulcers; any alteration of the appearance inside your 
                    mouth could be a warning sign. This is another reason to see a dentist regularly 
                    and have your mouth checked—-your regular dental visit may actually save your life.

                <h4>Mouth Guards and Night Guards</h4>
                <p>It is not just a piece of plastic to prevent grinding. A well fit night guard can 
                    prevent migraine pain and tension-type headache pain. By positioning your jaw slightly 
                    forward, it also can help sleep apnea.

            <div class="cosmetic-overview">
                At Best Smile 4 U, we feel honored to see patients through their journey to a happier, 
                more confident smile. Nothing makes us happier than getting to be a part of the 
                emotional response after a patient sees their new smile for the first time. Whether 
                your teeth are stained, chipped, misshapen, or unevenly spaced, we’ll listen to your 
                needs and develop a treatment plan to correct unwanted imperfections.

            <div class="cosmetic-subsection">
                <h4>Veneers</h4>
                <p>If you have concerns are chipped, discolored, uneven, or misaligned teeth, Veneers can 
                    cover up almost any cosmetic flaw and ensure that you have a bright, white, and 
                    beautiful smile. In order to fit veneers seamlessly and look natural, a very thin 
                    layer of enamel will be removed from any teeth that will be receiving veneers. 
                    Then, your dentist will take multiple impressions and pictures to design a perfect 
                    smile for you.  During the wait time, you will wear a set of temporary 
                    veneers until the final veneers arrive. To keep your beautifully 
                    restored smile forever, we highly recommend you wear your night guard to protect your 
                    investment.

                    <h4>Invisalign</h4>
                    <p>If you look for a comfortable solution to align teeth that are crooked, overlapping, 
                        or have gaps between them, Invisalign can straighten teeth without braces. Your 
                        Invisalign treatment consists of a series of nearly invisible, removable aligners 
                        that you change every week for the next set of aligners. Each aligner is custom 
                        designed just for your teeth. As you replace each aligner, your teeth will move – 
                        little by little, week by week – until they have straightened to the final position 
                        prescribed by your dentist.

                <h4>Teeth Whitening</h4>
                <p>We offer wide variety of Teeth Whitening options for restoring your smile and your 
                    self-confidence. This treatment reverses tooth stains caused by the natural aging 
                    process, drinking dark beverages like coffee and tea, and improper oral hygiene 
                    habits. The complete procedure takes less than an hour, but a regular teeth 
                    cleaning is recommended prior to the actual teeth whitening session. For the 
                    popular Zoom in-office whitening, the procedure begins with a short preparation to 
                    cover the lips and gums, leaving the teeth exposed. Our dentist then applies the 
                    Zoom hydrogen peroxide whitening gel, which works together with the Zoom light to 
                    penetrate the teeth and break up the stains and discoloration. Afterwards, we do 
                    recommend you maintain an appropriate oral hygiene regimen to prevent stains from 
                    reforming, and see our dentist regularly for scheduled teeth cleanings.

                    undetectable restorative options. We listen to your needs to determine the best 
                    treatment for your smile and your budget. Depending on the broken teeth condition, 
                    the treatment options may vary from filling, crown, bridge, denture to implants. 
                    We want to restore your smile like no damage happened to them before.

                <h4>Dental Crowns and Bridges</h4>
                <p>Dental crowns are “caps” that cover the entire surface of the tooth above the gum 
                    line, restoring and protecting damaged teeth. Dental bridges replace one or more 
                    missing teeth by capping two adjacent “abutment teeth” and connect them together. 
                    Super floss or water floss will be needed to clean under the bridge.

            <div class="restorative-subsection">
                <h4>Removable Partial Dentures and Complete Dentures</h4>
                <p>Missing teeth can negatively affect your oral health and confidence, interfering 
                    with your daily life. Dentures are typically more affordable than other replacement 
                    options, so if you are missing your teeth and you’re on a budget, dentures may be 
                    the best choice for you. Besides restoring your smile and your bite, allowing you 
                    to eat, speak and smile normally once again. Partial dentures help prevent some of 
                    the complications associated with tooth loss, such as teeth shifting toward the 
                    empty socket where your missing tooth used to be. The limitation of denture is you 
                    do need to take off your denture before sleep and wash them well. Since they are 
                    mostly held into your mouth using friction, you cannot expect them function as 
                    natural teeth. For long term teeth replacement, implants and implant-supported 
                    dentures are advised.

                    <h4>Implants</h4>
                    <p>We know that missing teeth can cause emotional stress and lead to more dental 
                        health issues, and we’re here to help you navigate the process of choosing a 
                        replacement option. create a permanent, natural-looking prosthetic tooth that 
                        blends in with the rest of your smile.
                    </p>
                    <p>The process starts with a consultation at Best Smile 4 U. After our dentists examine your 
                        gums and jawbone to make sure you’re a good candidate for implants, we’ll connect 
                        you with a specialist who will surgically place a small titanium post into your 
                        gum line. Once this heals, our doctors will attach it to a custom restoration that is 
                        built to blend in with the rest of your teeth and look completely natural. You’ll 
                        leave our office with a brand new smile.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the best things about dental implants is that they can last a lifetime with 
                        proper oral care. The durability of dental implants is a major advantage, and this 
                        means that you won’t need to make multiple costly visits to get them replaced. 
                        Since they are surgically inserted into your jawbone and they are made to mimic a 
                        tooth root, they look and feel completely natural. Call us today to hear more about 
                        what dental implants can do for you!
